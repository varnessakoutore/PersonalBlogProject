                <p><em>Want to know what its like to learn HTML . . . keep reading. . . from my experience.</em></p>
                <p>I have been wanting to learn how to create my own website from scratch
                    for a very long time. I will say, it has been about 5 yrs or so I've
                    been very interested in learning. To be honest, it took me so long to learn 
                    because I didn't know where to go for the knowledge outside of a 2 or 4yr 
                    college. Recently, within the last year, I found out about certifications. 
                    The best part about that is, there are programs that allows you to take them 
                    for FREE!!!<br>
                    <br>
                    From the perspective of a single mother, that is very beneficial for growth.
                    Look at it as you, at this point, can make no excuses for your growth. There are 
                    things in place to ensure your success in life. We just have to find it. Whether you 
                    find it in your 20s or find it in your 50s, either way you found it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now I do wish I found out about these course and certifications in my early 20s. I 
                    wish I even knew about the tech industry in my early 20s. Imagine how much more successful
                    I would have been. Anyway, nobody have time for the wishes and should've could've. 
                    <q>Things aren't always #000000 and #ffffff.</q> Somebody once said that, which was very clever.<br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you so much for reading a little bit about my experience. I know its a little bit
                    incomplete, but one thing I will say is, it's never too late to learn and I'm glad I have
                    this opportunity.<br>
